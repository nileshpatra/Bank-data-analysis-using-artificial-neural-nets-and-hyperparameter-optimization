- ANALYSED BANK DATA USING A ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NET
- THE DATASET WAS OBTAINED FROM www.superdatascience.com
- THE DATASET WAS IMPORTED AND A ROBUST MODEL WAS SETUP USING KERAS 
- THE NUMBER OF EPOXHS ARENT VERY HIGH BECAUSE OF THE OVERWHELMING COMPUTATIONAL EXPENSIVENESS OF THE ALGORITHM
- IN THE END A DECENT ACCURACY WAS OBTAINED FOR THE DATASET
